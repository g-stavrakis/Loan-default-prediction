## Business Context

A major bank wants to better predict the likelihood of default for its customers, as well as identify the key drivers that determine this likelihood. They hope that this would inform the bank’s decisions on who to give a credit to and what credit limit to provide, as well as also help the bank have a better understanding of their current and potential customers, which would inform their future strategy, including their planning of offering targeted credit products to their customers.

## Data

The dataset that was provided for this project contained various information about 25,000 bank clients, including demographic factors, credit data, history of payment, and bill statements from April to September, as well as information on whether the customer default or not in October.
Of those 25,000 clients, 1,000 were randomly selected as the test set and stored on “New_applications.csv” file and the remain 24,000 on “Credit_data.csv”, which was used to train and validate the model.
