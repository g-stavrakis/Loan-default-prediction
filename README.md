## Business Context

A major bank wants to better predict the likelihood of default for its customers, as well as identify the key drivers that determine this likelihood. 
They hope that this would inform the bankâ€™s decisions on who to give a credit to and what credit limit to provide, as well as also help the bank have
a better understanding of their current and potential customers, which would inform their future strategy, including their planning of offering targeted
credit products to their customers.
